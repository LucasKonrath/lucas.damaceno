           <h5>My daughter? Wait a minute, I have a daughter? You see, this one event starts a chain reaction which completely destroys your entire family. (Marty looks at the paper again.) Hey Doc, this date...wait, this is tomorrow's newspaper! Precisely! I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens. I backtracked everything to this one event, that's why we're here today to prevent this incident from ever happening. (His watch beeps.) Damn, I'm late!</h5>
